<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
  QR Scout Hub is a program to manage scouting efforts for
  <span title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</span> competitions events.
  It is intended to be used to collect, store, and analyze data collected
  by "scouts" during matches.
</p>
<p>
  This program was inspired by the efforts of FRC 2713, Red Hawk Robotics,
  and their <i>QR Scout</i> program which transmits scouting data via QR
  codes. The QR Scout Hub is intended to be fully compatible with 2713's
  QR Scout and its game configuration files.
<p>

<h2 id="howto">How to use QR Scout Hub</h2>

<p>
  QR Scout Hub can be used for three major activities:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Building a Game Configuration from scratch</li>
  <li>Collecting scouting data during a competition</li>
  <li>Running analytics against the collected data</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="howto_building">Building a Game Configuration</h3>

<p>
  To build a new Game Configuration (or to import one you got from another
  team), first create a new <b>Project</b> by selecting "New..." from the
  <i>File</i> menu.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to use an existing Game Configuration file, choose
  "Import Config..." from the <i>Project</i>i> menu.
</p>

<p>
  You can then review or modify the Game Configuration as necessary by choosing
  "Edit Game..." from the <i>Project</i> menu.
</p>

<p>
  Once your Game Configuration is looking good, you can test it locally by
  choosing "Launch Web Application" from the <i>Project</i> menu. This will
  let you preview the QR Scout that your scouting team will be using
  (if you would like to use our QR Scout). Once you are happy with that,
  choose "Export Web Application..." from the <i>Project</i> menu to export
  the QR Scout as a web application in a ZIP file. You can upload and expand
  this onto your web server for your scouts to use during a competition.
</p>

<h3 id="howto_scouting">Scouting</h3>
<p>
  During matches, have your scouts use the QR Scout web application to record
  details of robots performances. After each match, each scout will generate a
  QR code containing the match data for a single robot. Click the big "Scan"
  button in the QR Scout Hub, then scan the QR code from the scouter's device.
  You'll see a preview of the data from the match at the bottom of the screen
  for confirmation. Then click the big "Import" button in the QR Scout Hub
  to import the data into the hub's database.
</p>

<p>
  You can view the whole database in two different ways if you'd like to take
  a peek: choose "Export Database" from the <i>Database</i> menu to view the
  data in CSV format, or choose "Edit Database..." from the <i>Database</i>
  menu to open an editor that will let you <i>make changes to the data in the
  database</i>. Be very careful with that second option: the changes you make
  are final and cannot be undone.
</p>

<h3 id="howto_analyzing">Building and Running Analytics</h3>
<p>
  One of the most powerful features of QR Scout is the ability to perform
  analytics on your scouting data right from within the QR Scout Hub
  application. There is no need to export your data for use in a spreadsheet
  or other analytics application (unless you really like those other analytics
  capabilities).
</p>

<p>
  Choose "Analytics..." from the <i>Database</i> menu to open the
  <b>Analytics</b> manager. If this is the first time you've opened it, the
  Analytics window will contain nothing other than a "New..." button.
  Otherwise, it will list each of the Analytics you have defined for the
  project. You can edit or run any of the Analytics and even keep those
  individual windows open during the competition.
</p>

<p>
  An Analytic is just a named SQL query for the database. To write a new
  Analytic, click the "New..." button in the Analytics window, then enter a
  name for your Analytic and a SQL query to run.
</p>

<p>
  To write a SQL query, you will need to be familiar with SQL query syntax.
  The database used for QR Scout Hub is Apache Derby. You can read their
  reference documentation here:
  <a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.17/ref/index.html">https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.17/ref/index.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There is only one table in the QR Scout Hub database, and its name is
  <code>stand_scouting</code>. Each of the columns in the database will match
  the <code>code</code> that you used for each scouting field. For example,
  if you have a field with the title "Teleop Score" and code "T_score", then
  you would use "<code>t_score</code>" in your SQL query. A simple Analytic
  query might be (assuming you also have a <code>teamNumber</code> field,
  which we highly recommend!):
</p>
<pre>
SELECT teamNumber, SUM(T_score) AS total_score
FROM stand_scouting
GROUP BY teamNumber
ORDER BY SUM(T_score) DESC
</pre>
<p>
  This uses an aggregation function (<code>SUM</code>code>) to compute the
  total "Teleop Score" for each team (due to the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause)
  and then <code>ORDER BY</code> that same total Teleop Score putting the
  highest team at the top. We would recommend that you use more nuanced
  analytics than this example, but this should be enough to get you started.
