<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
  QR Scout Hub is a program to manage scouting efforts for
  <span title="FIRST Robotics Competition">FRC</span> competitions events.
  It is intended to be used to collect, store, and analyze data collected
  by "scouts" during matches.
</p>
<p>
  This program was inspired by the efforts of FRC 2713, Red Hawk Robotics,
  and their <i>QR Scout</i> program which transmits scouting data via QR
  codes. The QR Scout Hub is intended to be fully compatible with 2713's
  QR Scout and its game configuration files.
